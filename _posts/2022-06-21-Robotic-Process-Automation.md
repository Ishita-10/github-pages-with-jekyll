## What is RPA ?

Robotic process automation (RPA) is a software technology that makes it easy to build, deploy, and manage software robots that emulate humans actions interacting with digital systems and software. Just like people, software robots can do things like understand what’s on a screen, complete the right keystrokes, navigate systems, identify and extract data, and perform a wide range of defined actions. But software robots can do it faster and more consistently than people, without the need to get up and stretch or take a coffee break.

## Softwares that work with RPA:
1. UiPath
2. Blue Prism
3. Automation Anywhere

## Where can RPA be used ?
Today, RPA is driving new efficiencies and freeing people from repetitive tedium across a broad swath of industries and processes.
RPA has become so widespread because it is broadly applicable. Virtually any high-volume, business-rules-driven, repeatable process is a great candidate for automation—and increasingly so are cognitive processes that require higher-order AI skills.
